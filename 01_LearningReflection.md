
## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- The experience is worthless. The whole course I was dreaming about practicing all the theory in real-life tasks. 
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I managed test cases by breaking down the requirements into specific scenarios that needed validation. I started by identifying key functionalities to test and then developed test cases that addressed each function's positive and negative outcomes. I organized these cases using a spreadsheet or a test case management tool, ensuring proper coverage and traceability. 
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
- Yes, I recommend using dedicated test case management tools like TestRail. These tools help to organize test cases, track results, and collaborate with team members more efficiently than spreadsheets. For small projects or teams with budget constraints, using spreadsheets like Google Sheets or Excel can work well.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code for editing files. It offers a wide range of extensions for various programming languages, integrated Git support, and an overall smooth experience for code editing and test case development.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- no, I have not faced any serious difficulties. The only one was inconsistent behavior of the app, but it might be just connection.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I faced some trouble with GitHub, primarily when resolving merge conflicts and understanding complex Git workflows. I have used GitHub before for personal projects. To resolve the issues, I followed GitHub's tips which are described when I was searching how to resolve the issue. Their own page provides different solution to a similar problem, so even beginner can find it out. Also, I used visual tools like GitHub Desktop to simplify operations. Also, I have a difficulty managing large repositories, making own profile less messy and more orginized. 
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would use Selenium with Python for automation. Selenium is highly versatile, supports multiple languages, and integrates with various frameworks and tools. It allows automated testing across different browsers and is widely used in the industry, providing a lot of community support and resources. I've heard so much about it in Testing society, however Robot Framework is also usefull tool which I will consider, because it uses a keyword-driven approach, making it easy to create and manage test cases. It also supports reusability, allowing the creation of reusable test suites, keywords, and test case templates. 


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Common skills and competencies for software testing roles are:
        Knowledge of test automation tools (e.g., Selenium, Cypress)
        Experience with test case management tools
        Strong programming skills (e.g., Python, Java)
        Understanding of test frameworks (e.g., JUnit, TestNG)
        Experience with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
        Familiarity with Agile methodologies
        Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail




## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- For technical skills, I would focus on improving test automation, programming languages(currently, focusing on Python), and understanding test frameworks. Learning deeply about performance and security testing could also be beneficial.
- For soft skills, communication and teamwork are critical in testing environments. Developing problem-solving skills, adaptability, and a proactive approach to identifying issues are also essential for successfull software Tester career.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- The project for me is a valuable experience, which allows to put all my theoretical knowledge(gained during the course) into practice. Working on the tasks helped to make my understanding of key concepts in software testing stronger, including test case development and bug reporting. Moreover, it gives a clear picture how external tools and apps may help in real-life work.
